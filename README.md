Our artefact is an electronic educational game for children with special needs. 

The core game mechanic is based off of ‘Boggle’, a word game where players must find words within a grid of mixed letters under a time constraint.

# Getting Started
This game is written in C# using the unity engine but can be run without either installed on your system
For PC navigate to the repository directory and either clone or download the game.

For android devices, the F-Droid and Android store will have our game available under the name **SpellBlitz**.
